# Description

**File Integrity Checker** is a simple yet powerful Python-based tool designed to help developers, system administrators, and security-conscious users **track changes in important files** using cryptographic hash comparisons. The tool ensures that any unauthorized, accidental, or malicious changes to files are detected promptly and clearly.

Whether you're maintaining a set of critical configuration files, managing scripts in a production environment, or just want to keep an eye on sensitive documents, this tool offers a lightweight and effective solution for **file integrity verification**.

##  What Is File Integrity Checking?

File Integrity Checking is the process of validating the integrity of files by comparing their current state to a known good baseline. This is typically done using cryptographic hash functions, such as SHA-256, which produce a unique digital fingerprint of a file's contents. If the file changes, even slightly, the resulting hash will differ — allowing you to detect the change immediately.

This script uses Python’s built-in `hashlib` library to calculate hashes and stores them in a simple JSON file (`file_hashes.json`). Each time the script runs, it compares the current file hashes against the saved ones to detect:

- **NEW** files that weren’t previously tracked
- **MODIFIED** files that have changed
- **DELETED** files that are no longer present

##  Features

-  **No dependencies** – only standard Python libraries (`hashlib`, `os`, `json`, `argparse`)
-  Uses secure cryptographic hash algorithms (default: `SHA-256`)
-  Maintains a persistent JSON database of file hashes
-  Detects new, modified, and deleted files
-  Supports monitoring of one or many files at once
-  Useful for security audits, system configuration tracking, or backup verification
-  Fully scriptable and suitable for automation via cron jobs or task schedulers

##  Installation

To use the File Integrity Checker, you only need Python 3.7 or above installed.
